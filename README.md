# Pattern Simulator

Custom tool for a private project. For the purpose of this project, a "pattern" is a collection of phases describing particle spawn positions. The phases are separated by a time interval. As a result different patterns will result in different visual appearance when affected by physics.

I have made this in order to familiarise myself more with XCode and Swift. Also to learn more about SpriteKit and UI on MacOS.

Features:
- Pattern editor
- Pattern simulation
- Copy/pasting patterns as raw text
